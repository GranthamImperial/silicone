- (`#94 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/94>`_) Added :class:`EqualQuantileWalk`, a cruncher which finds the quantile of the lead variable in the infiller database and returns the same quantile of the follow variable.
- (`#87 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/87>`_) Added :class:`TimeDepQuantileRollingWindows`, a cruncher which allows the user to crunch different quantiles in different years.
- (`#86 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/86>`_) Slightly changed the definition of quantile rolling windows to make it symmetric (not rounding down).
- (`#83 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/83>`_) Added tests for appending results of crunching to the input.
- (`#82 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/82>`_) Updated to a later version of pyam and solved todos associated with this. Also added a ``kwargs`` argument to ``infill_all_required``.
- (`#80 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/80>`_) Changed the names of crunchers for brevity. Also changed ``lead_gas`` to ``latest_time_ratio`` and included it in ratio notebook.
- (`#78 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/78>`_) Changed how quantile rolling windows works by adding an extra interpolate step for smoothness
- (`#77 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/77>`_) Added calculation of variance of rank correlation to stats
- (`#76 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/76>`_) Removed command-line interface
- (`#75 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/75>`_) Updated README
- (`#72 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/72>`_) Altered infill_composite_value to allow multiplication by a factor before summing. Removed unnecessary notebooks.
- (`#69 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/69>`_) Fixed bug so that ``DatabaseCruncherRMSClosest`` no longer selects scenarios which don't have follower data
- (`#68 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/68>`_) More investigatory tools and scripts for calculating and outputting emissions correlations.
- (`#67 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/67>`_) Introduce investigatory tools for plotting relations between emissions.
- (`#66 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/66>`_) Remove ``Input`` folder in favour of using ``openscm-units``
- (`#65 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/65>`_) Add ``format-notebooks`` target to the ``Makefile``

- (`#52 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/52>`_) Made the Lead Gas infiller use the average latest data rather than being restricted to a single value. Updated infill_composite_values to work with the latest data.
- (`#51 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/51>`_) Split the notebooks into chapters with minor changes to the text. Moved a script function into utilities to download data.
- (`#49 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/49>`_) Rewrote the documentation and notebooks to update, split up information and clarify.
- (`#48 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/48>`_) Introduced multiple_infiller function to calculate the composite values from the constituents.
- (`#47 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/47>`_) Made an option for quantile_rolling_windows to infill using the ratio of lead to follow data.
- (`#46 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/46>`_) Made the time-dependent ratio infiller only use data where the leader has the same sign.
- (`#45 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/45>`_) Made infill_all_required_emissions_for_openscm, the second multiple-infiller function.
- (`#44 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/44>`_) Made decompose_collection_with_time_dep_ratio, the first multiple-infiller function.
- (`#43 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/43>`_) Implemented new util functions for downloading data, unit conversion and data checking.
- (`#41 <https://github.com/znicholls/silicone/pull/41>`_) Added a cruncher to interpolate values between data from specific scenarios. Only test notebooks with lax option.
